Hello everyone! This is my [MirrorReddit](https://reddinamix.fun) version. 
I have developed an application to show my skills as a frontend (React, Node JS) software engineer.

in my https://reddinamix.fun, I have implemented:
1) [React-window](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window) (infinite content loading). I've optimized it to avoid unnecessary re-renders, so the images in the content do not "blink" after loading.
2) [React-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) and [Redux-persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist)
3) [React-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
4) [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
   and much more...
